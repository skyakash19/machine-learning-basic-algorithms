📚 Machine Learning Basic Algorithms
Welcome to the Machine Learning Basic Algorithms repository! This project provides an introduction to essential machine learning algorithms with intuitive explanations and easy-to-follow implementations. It's perfect for beginners and those looking to strengthen their foundation.

🧠 Algorithms Included
1. Adaptive Linear Neuron (Adaline):
Adaline is a single-layer neural network that uses a linear activation function. It minimizes error using gradient descent, making it a foundation for modern deep learning. Ideal for binary classification tasks.

2. Find-S Algorithm:
Find-S identifies the most specific hypothesis that matches all positive examples. It’s simple and effective for noise-free datasets with fully positive examples.

3. Candidate Elimination Algorithm:
This algorithm narrows down hypotheses using a version space approach. It maintains specific and general boundaries, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data.

4. Decision Tree Classifier (ID3):
ID3 is a decision-making algorithm that splits data using Information Gain. It creates interpretable tree structures for classification problems.

5. Naive Bayes Classifier:
This probabilistic model assumes independence among features and uses Bayes' theorem to classify data. Its simplicity makes it incredibly effective, especially for text classification.

6. K-Means Clustering:
An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into clusters. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster center for customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and more.

7. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
A lazy learning algorithm that bases classification on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. Simple, robust, and ideal for smaller datasets.

8. Locally Weighted Regression (LWR):
A non-parametric algorithm that emphasizes nearby points to fit a regression line. Perfect for modeling non-linear relationships with local data.
